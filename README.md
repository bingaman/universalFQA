# Universal FQA Calculator 

Floristic Quality Assessments (FQAs) are measurements of a natural area's habitat condition based on species coefficients of conservatism and wetness. FQAs are widely used by government agencies and conservation groups to inform land management decisions.

This web-based tool calculates site inventory and transect FQAs. FQA databases published for a number of geographic regions have already been imported into the website, and users can import and customize other FQA databases as needed.

This project is being developed with the support of http://openlands.org
