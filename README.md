# Universal FQA Calculator 

Floristic Quality Assessments (FQAs) are measurements of a natural area's habitat condition based on species coefficients of conservatism and wetness. They are widely used by government agencies and conservation groups to inform land management decisions.

This web-based tool calculates site inventory and transect FQAs. Existing FQA databases for any geographic region can be used or modified, and as new FQA databases are developed they can be uploaded to the website.

This project is being developed with the support of http://openlands.org
