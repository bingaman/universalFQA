# Universal FQA Calculator 

Floristic Quality Assessments (FQAs) are a measurement of a natural area's habitat condition or quality. This web-based tool will calculate site inventory and transect FQAs. An FQA for a natural area is calculated using coefficients stored in the geographic region's FQA database. Any existing FQA database can be used or modified, and as new FQA databases are developed for other regions they can be uploaded to the website.
